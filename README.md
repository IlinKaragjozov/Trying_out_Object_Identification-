# Trying_out_Object_Identification-
Experimenting with object identification.
My goal here is to try out various different things with CNNs and object identification. One of the files is essentially babys' first try at something that resembles object identification, and serves to play around with simple CNNs. Next after that I want play around with various different prebuilt CNNs in order to play around with everything that is available. Ultimately, I want to try making my own proper multi-object identification CNN from scratch.
